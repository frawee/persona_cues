Here's a more detailed explanation of what antioxidants are:\\n\\nOxidation is a normal chemical reaction that occurs in the body during normal cell metabolism. It can also be induced by external factors like pollution, smoking, etc. During oxidation, molecules called free radicals are produced. These are unstable atoms that are missing an electron and will take electrons from other molecules, causing damage to cells.\\n\\nOver time, excessive levels of free radicals in the body can lead to a variety of health problems including heart disease, autoimmune disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer.\\n\\nAntioxidants are compounds that neutralize free radicals by donating an electron. This stabilizes the free radicals so they no longer take electrons from and damage other cells. Common antioxidants that our bodies produce naturally include glutathione, coenzyme Q10, superoxide dismutase, catalase and others. We also obtain antioxidants from foods like fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and even chocolate. \\n\\nBy counteracting oxidative damage from free radicals, antioxidants play a key role in maintaining health and preventing disease.

Short games mean players need to make decisions quickly and allow for quick transitions between rounds, keeping the atmosphere lively.\\n\\nThat being said, consider your venue and schedule carefully.
